                About Me
            </h3>
            <p class="large-hero__about-me__text">
                I have always had a fascination with solving problems and building things. After 7 years in Finance, I decided it was time
                to turn my fascination into a passion. Via FreeCodeCamp, I have been pursuing a education in web development.
                I have had a great time learning new things everyday and applying my knowledge to building projects. I am
                looking to take my knowledge and passion into a full-time role, where I can continue to grow and learn.
